# Milestone 1 - Pacoâ€™s Wing Bar - by Russell Oakham

## Project overview

The project is a small website for a restaurant based in Bristol. The main purpose would be to get people interested in booking a reservation at the restaurant. The website promotes that the restaurant is a small independant business, whose menu is inspired by international street food. 

## UX

Overview of UX decisions, structure etc. Examples of websites I have viewed as part of research & UX decisions from it.

### User Stories

This section provides insight into the UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how this project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

Visitors to this website are searching for:
 - Restaurants in Bristol, specialising in chicken wings and burgers.
 - Restaurants in Bristol, run independently.
 - Restaurants in Bristol, with an upbeat atmosphere.

 ## Strategy
The main goals of the website:

### Scope
This section determines what the users should be able to do on the website.

### Structure
At this point I started thinking about what information, pages, features, and calls to action were to necessary and how they would be grouped.

### Skeleton
At this point I began creating proper wireframes, considering how the User will navigate through the site, what content has priority, and interelation of content.

### Surface
This is the sensory design section of a website, or how it looks, feels and sounds. I wanted the design to be clean and the colour scheme to be light and refreshing.

The project is a small website for a restaurant based in Bristol. The sites main purpose is to get entice new or previous customers to book a reservation at the restaurant. The website promotes that the restaurant is a small independant business, whose menu is inspired by international street food.

## 1. UX

Overview of UX decisions, structure etc. Examples of websites I have viewed as part of research & resulting UX design decisions.

### User Stories

 - As a business owner, I want to build awareness of the restaurant within Bristol, so as to attract new or returning customers.
 - As a business owner, I want to advertise the products we produce and culture of the business, so as to attract new or returning customers.
 - As a business owner, I want to offer the ability for customers to book a reservation online, to avoid unnecessary calls during busy hours.
 
 - As a user, I want a simple and clean looking website, so information is easy to digest and not overwhelming.
 - As a user, I want an easy to navigate website, to save time and avoid frustration.
 - As a user, I want to be able to access the website on desktop, tablet and mobile devices, to ensure high convenience.

 - As a user, I want to be able to get in contact with the restaurant, to be able to ask additional questions.
 - As a user, I want to know the opening hours and location of the restaurant, so I can easily find the premises on the day of reservation.
 - As a user, I want to know the products on offer and the price, so I can ensure the products are attractive and within my personal budget prior to visiting.
 - As a curious user, I want to know about the restaurant's culture, to ensure it aligns to my own ethics and/or desires.
 - As a curious user, I want to read reviews from other customers to the restaurant, to know if i should expect a positive experience
 - As a user, I want to be able to cater my booking for special occasions, so the restaurant is aware in advance.

### Structure
At this point I started thinking about what information, pages, features, and calls to action were too necessary and how they would be grouped.

I wanted to keep the structure simple, restricting design to 4-5 key content pages so potential customers would not feel overwhelmed or 'spammed' by irrelevant information. I identified key content pages to be;

- Home Page: Containing brief overview of restaurant ethos, call-to-action (book online), location and contact details.
- About Us: Containing more in depth explanation of restaurant ethos, culture, menu inspiration, team members of unique selling points.
- Menu: Containing current menu propositions of the restaurant, allowing potential customers a view of what the restaurant offers and at what prices. Taking a transparent approach to this will increase customer loyalty.
- Online Booking: Page to enable customers to submit table reservation requests.

### Skeleton
At this point I began creating proper wireframes, considering how the User will navigate through the site, what content has priority, and interrelation of content. I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create the below wireframes:

 - [Home page on mobile and desktop wireframe](/workspace/ci-milestone-project-1/wireframes/home-desktop-mobile.pdf)
 - [About Us page on mobile and desktop wireframe](/workspace/ci-milestone-project-1/wireframes/about-us-desktop-mobile.pdf)
 - [Menu page on mobile and desktop wireframe](/workspace/ci-milestone-project-1/wireframes/menu-desktop-mobile.pdf)
 - [Online Reservation page on mobile and desktop wireframe](/workspace/ci-milestone-project-1/wireframes/menu-desktop-mobile.pdf)

### Surface
This is the sensory design section of a website, or how it looks, feels and sounds. I wanted the design to be clean and the colour scheme to be light and refreshing. 

#### Colour
As the restaurant is inspired by South American and international street food, I was keen to choose a colour scheme reminiscent of South America. With this in mind, I chose to use a predominantly blue, yellow and red colour scheme. These colours feature strongly in the flags of South American countries, as well as their sporting colours - e.g. Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Costa Rica.

Additionally, the colours blue, yellow and red evoke the emotional responses I would like to evoke in potential customers. According to [this article on 99 designs](https://99designs.co.uk/blog/tips/how-color-impacts-emotions-and-behaviors/), the colours I've chosen evoke the following responses;

 - Blue: Safety and Relaxation
 - Yellow: Happy and Spontaneous
 - Red: Passionate and Energised.

 These emotions should help promote the fresh and exciting feel of the street food menu we wish to convey, while exciting potential customers to make a booking.

 Once I'd chosen the colour scheme, I chose to use the sky blue tone found in the Argentinian flag (#74ACDF) as a starting point and input this to [palleton](https://paletton.com/). As I felt this original blue was slightly too pale, I played with the colour until I found a more vibrant blue I felt was fitting to the aesthetic feel I wanted. I decided upon using Blue hex code #3BA5B4.

 To complement my colour scheme I chose the 'triad' option on my palleton which provided me with two supplementary colours, blue and yellow, which I made additional small tweaks to. 
 
 The complete colour scheme provided by palleton is below, including paler/brighter options.

#### Language/Tone 
I wanted the language to reflect the casual and fun atmosphere of the restaurant, so content was written in line with this. Avoiding technical or formal language where possible.

#### Styling Considerations
Before beginning development, I listed some styling ideas that I felt benefit the website. Majority of these can be seen in the wireframes.

 - Favicon: Desktop and Mobile.
 - Menu: 
    - Card design, which reacts to mouse hover (transform: Zoom) to add a level of interaction and excitement to products.
    - Ability to download pdf version of menu in printable format for customer convenience.
 - Navigation
    - Sticky top
    - Mobile: 'Burger' menu icon, expanding on click.
    - Logo: Navigates to home page on click.
 - Location: Embed Google Map iframe showing restaurant location.
